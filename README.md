# 💼 Henry Pineda Jr. | Professional Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills in **Frontend Development** and **Automation/System Specialization**.

Built with React (Vite), styled using Tailwind CSS, and utilizing the shadcn/ui component library for an accessible and modern aesthetic. This portfolio was also developed with the assistance of Gemini 3 Pro.

## ✨ Features

This portfolio includes several modern design features and custom components built from scratch:

- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized layout for PC, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Custom Theme:** Implements a dark mode toggle with custom **OKLCH color variables** for seamless theme switching.
- **Dynamic Header:** A sticky navigation bar that transitions from a larger, semi-transparent state to a solid, slightly shorter state upon scrolling.
- **Skills Showcase:** An auto-scrolling **Carousel** with custom, animated **5-star progress bars** to visually represent expertise levels.
- **Interactive Experience Timeline:** A unique vertical timeline where a **dynamic progress line** fills up as the user scrolls, activating card animations and visual markers (dots).
